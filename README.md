# Chess
Praticing my OO Design skills.

The goal of this is to work things out in my head and come up with a simple OO design pattern for the game of chess.  I will not be looking to web to try to copy or re-use any existing design paradigms.  The game will have user input and hooks for visual components.  It will probably be MVC heavy.  There are no plans for having a computer based player at this time.

If this works out and I don't loose interest then I will build out the game in c, c++, java, python, perl, and other languages.  Exploring the pro's and cons of these languages and how well they fit the OO design, and memory usage of each game.
